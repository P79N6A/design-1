          <p>
            When it comes to user experience, HTML form is one of the most
            discussed elements on the plate. Usually a form required experience
            designers and product managers to understand how the business work
            and what are the users’ expectations and how do they behave or
            interact with the form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently we revamped our China-to-US ocean freight service, one of
            the key elements to the service is the logistic solution search and
            quotation tool. Here is how it look like before we do the update:
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1EaelEQzoK1RjSZFlXXai4VXa-451-233.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Data shows that most of our users on this China-to-US ocean freight
            service are new to international sea freight. They are experiencing
            different kinds of difficulties, for example, they are not
            experienced in sea freight and do not understand all professional
            logistic terms. And thus, the form above become obstacle to them.
            That is why we are trying to improve the form and make it more user
            friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not rush to revamp the tool, but try to throw out questions
            and see if there is any fundamental way to overcome hurdles to
            users. One of the directions is while users are so unfamiliar with
            international logistic, will it better to offer a human-to-human
            help service instead of a self-help service?
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1hYWeENTpK1RjSZR0XXbEwXXa-698-180.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            So, we come up with the above prototype with a manual quote
            function: User leave us their contact information and our
            representative will contact them directly if users are not
            confidence enough to fill out all info. It turns out users welcome
            this old service style - despite slower responsible time and more
            back and forth communications. However, the cost of this service
            model will be too high and it is obvious that scaling and
            maintaining service standard will be a huge problem in the future:
            Self-service is not avoidable in the era of internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            To in heritage the idea of a human touch service, in the next
            prototype we added an option with ‘I am not sure’ option. Whenever
            users are not sure how to fill in the form, we allow them to contact
            us. Once they checked the I’m not sure option, a set of contact box
            will be appeared. And our staff will able to follow the case.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1RrKcENTpK1RjSZFGXXcHqFXa-451-146.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Apart from I’m not sure option, we also looked into the fills. It
            turn out some users understand what is gross volume but not able to
            process the calculation. Thus we offered a little calculator for
            them. To improve user experience, even the little calculator tool
            takes a few versions to polish.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1JTudEFYqK1RjSZLeXXbXppXa-451-334.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            After exercising visualization of the calculator, we learnt users
            want more direct and simple form of communication. Thus, we tried to
            visualize the shipping route through service mode:
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1fzODENnaK1RjSZFBXXcW7VXa-451-189.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            But it turns out visualizing service mode will increase the digest
            cost to user. Even it gives a complete process path but it also
            confused user on which is the right path for them. In this case a
            simple text label is more understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further assist users to quickly adapt to our solution search
            tool, we added call to action copies to the fill label which
            encouraging users to input needed information. We also added
            guided-text in fill place holder, that give a better idea on what is
            expected to be filled in. And of course explanations next to fill
            label is extremely important to our not-so-experienced users.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1FIWfEHrpK1RjSZTEXXcWAVXa-451-179.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            All of the above bring lots of positive feedback from different
            users. To wrap it up, a successful html form should contain clear
            guideline, simple text label, mini-tool would be a plus when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After launch of the new version, our study shows that users
            sometimes do not realized the measurement unit is actually a
            dropdown. Especially in western world there are different metrics
            system, users will be confused when the tool only showing one
            measuring system. That why on the next update when adding new
            service to our ocean freight service, we expose all option with a
            switch element. This is much clearer to users and reduced a lot of
            confusion.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1OZqiESzqK1RjSZFpXXakSXXa-451-222.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            On the next step, we will talk about the quotation display part of
            this ocean freight logistic service.
          </p>
          <p>
            what happen after user filled in the form and how do we update the
            search result - quotation. This is what happen after user input
            necessary information and click the search button on the ocean
            freight solution search and quotation tool. Our system will match
            the enquiry and solutions service provider offered, making a
            quotation for that specific order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is how it look like together with the search tool before we do
            the update:
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1R78.EMDqK1RjSZSyXXaxEVXa-451-203.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>Quotation is simplified into 7 sections.</p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1e95mEIfpK1RjSZFOXXa6nFXa-451-214.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Users will able to expand the quotation with detailed breakdowns
            with charges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the business complexity natural, quotation of sea freight
            logistic can be complicated to average users. Even worst is in
            previous version, service charge breakdown is not detailed enough,
            some of the calculation is not completely shown even in the detail
            breakdown. This will certainly affect user’s trust on the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from unclear breakdowns, studies also found users are not able
            to understand what charge terms are, like Original Charges, Freight
            Charge and Destination Charge. That is why we introduced a
            visualized trade terms and steps into the service charge break down.
            This reduces the digest cost of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the diagram, user will able to understand the logistic terms
            and step easily. And this also helped to set user expectation on
            what is going to happen next. We used two colors to separate which
            part of the logistic flow is paid and liable on which party. By this
            buyer and seller will easily understand where the service charges
            goes to.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img
              src="https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1hdeiESzqK1RjSZFpXXakSXXa-451-203.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            On the price detail breakdown, we took out supplier cost on buyer’s
            quotation. And vice versa buyer’s cost will not show on supplier’s
            quotation. It is because our study found both parties do not care
            about how much the other side have to. They are more concern on how
            much they are paying for the service.
          </p>
          <div class="img-box">
            <img

          <p>
            To better illustrate the different in different trade term and
            liability condition, here are collection of different trade terms
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Here is how the page look like together with new search tool and
            quotation layout:

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            In summary, this revamped sea freight solution search and quotation
            project had bring a easier-to-use form to users with simplified
            form, call to action contents, widget tool, process visualization
            and a reader friendly cost breakdown. Data shows there is increase
            in success order rate and we got different positive feedback from
            users. Hope this sharing will bring you some inspirations.
